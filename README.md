✨ **Welcome to the QuestSpecialty Safety Data Repository!** ✨  
This project is an **open-source collection of Safety Data Sheets (SDS) and Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS)** for **QuestSpecialty** products. Our mission is to make vital safety information **accessible, easy to understand, and available to everyone**—from students and educators to workers, first responders, and families.

## 🌟 Why This Repository Exists

Chemicals play an important role in our daily lives, but they can also carry **hidden risks**. Products like aerosols, cleaners, lubricants, and degreasers may cause harm if used improperly. That’s why QuestSpecialty produces **SDS/MSDS documents**—to inform users about hazards, safe handling, first-aid measures, and emergency procedures.

Unfortunately, these documents are often scattered or difficult to access. This repository brings them together into **one welcoming, open-source resource** for:

- 📚 **Education** – Helping students and teachers understand real-world chemical safety.
- 🧑‍🔬 **AI & Research** – Providing structured data for building smarter tools and systems.
- 🧑‍🏭 **Workers & Technicians** – Offering quick access to safe handling and hazard information.
- 🧑‍⚕️ **Healthcare & First Responders** – Supplying accurate emergency guidance when every second counts.
- 🏠 **Families & Communities** – Promoting awareness to keep homes and neighborhoods safe.

By sharing this knowledge openly, we aim to create a safer, better-informed world. 🌍❤️
